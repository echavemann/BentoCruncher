bentocruncher eats bentos and gives you the delicious financial data that is stored within

ohlcv-1m-parser: 
    1. expects a metadata.json file to be put under same directory as the notebook
    2. takes in 1 raw file (ohlcv-1m from databento, can have multiple stocks, under same directory), outputs the processed file by stock.
        Note: output files are in csv format and will be separated by date and ticker, example: AAPL-2022-01-03.csv
